# PITE-PyTorch
Track Reconstruction using pytorch.

## Overview:

### The main goal of the project is to show in practise how different models perform with the problem of binary classification with data from LHCb experiment and how to build your own model using libraries like sklearn and pytorch.

### Model is suposed to predict if the partocle with given fitures will be possible to detect in downstream detectors or if it's a "gohst".

## Data:
### We got over two million samples with 10 features, splited in to two categories determine by **is_downstream_reconstructible** to work with:

### To understeand data we got we plot histograms of all fitures and compare them for
